# QCLightRad
Tool for calculating light/radiation coincidence for linear accelerators. The script opens a DICOM file and automatically detects the innermost bibs in the phantom using the Laplacian of Gaussian algorithm, for a 15 cm x 15 cm field. Tests have been done with a MED-TEC MT-IAD-1 and FC2 phantom. The final result is the distance between the difference of the center of the bib and radiation field edge minus the distance between the visible bib and the phantom edge. The software generates a pdf file with a summary of all the results.
